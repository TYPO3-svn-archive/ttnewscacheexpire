README:

tt_news elements with startime/stoptime should be shown at the correct time.

This extension needs extension cacheexpire.

This extension does not replace TCEMain.clearCacheCmd, but it
adds the possibilty to use starttime/stoptime without not caching
the news-plugins.

At the moment it is only a prove off concept, there should be
some finetuing possible.
