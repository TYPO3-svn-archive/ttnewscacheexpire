README:

at the moment i have to wait about the changes - if and how they go to the core, so that this extension
could use them - and i could write cacheexpire the same, so this extension could use with < TYPO3 4.3

tt_news elements with startime/stoptime should be shown at the correct time.

This extension needs extension cacheexpire.

This extension does not replace TCEMain.clearCacheCmd, but it
adds the possibilty to use starttime/stoptime without not caching
the news-plugins.

At the moment it is only a prove off concept, there should be
some finetuing possible.
